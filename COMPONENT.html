                <h3>I/O Devices</h3>
                <h5> An input is data that a computer receives. An output is data that a
                    computer
                    sends.An input device sends information to a computer system for processing, and an output device
                    reproduces or
                    displays the results of that processing. Input devices only allow for input of data to a computer
                    and
                    output
                    devices only receive the output of data from another device.

                    Most devices are only input devices or output devices, as they can only accept data input from a
                    user or
                    output
                    data generated by a computer. However, some devices can accept input and display output, and they
                    are
                    referred
                    to as I/O devices (input/output devices).

                    For example, a keyboard sends electrical signals, which are received as
                    input. Those signals are then interpreted by the computer and displayed, or output, on the monitor
                    as
                    text or
                    images. The computer sends, or outputs, data to a printer. Then, that data is
                    printed onto a piece of paper, which is also considered output.To know more click

            <h3>Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU)</h3>
            <h5 class="mx-4"> An arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) is the part of a computer processor (CPU) that carries out
                arithmetic and logic operations on the operands in computer instruction words. In some processors,
                the ALU is divided into two units, an arithmetic unit (AU) and a logic unit (LU).
                Typically, the ALU has direct input and output access to the processor controller, main memory
                (random access memory or RAM in a personal computer), and input/output devices. Inputs and outputs
                flow along an electronic path that is called a bus. The input consists of an instruction word
                (sometimes called a machine instruction word) that contains an operation code (sometimes called an
                "op code"), one or more operands, and sometimes a format code. The operation code tells the ALU what
                operation to perform and the operands are used in the operation. (For example, two operands might be
                added together or compared logically.) The format may be combined with the op code and tells, for
                example, whether this is a fixed-point or a floating-point instruction. The output consists of a
                result that is placed in a storage register and settings that indicate whether the operation was
                performed successfully. (If it isn't, some sort of status will be stored in a permanent place that
                is sometimes called the machine status word.)

                In general, the ALU includes storage places for input operands, operands that are being added, the
                accumulated result (stored in an accumulator), and shifted results. The flow of bits and the
                operations performed on them in the subunits of the ALU is controlled by gated circuits. The gates
                in these circuits are controlled by a sequence logic unit that uses a particular algorithm or
                sequence for each operation code. In the arithmetic unit, multiplication and division are done by a
                series of adding or subtracting and shifting operations. There are several ways to represent
                negative numbers. In the logic unit, one of 16 possible logic operations can be performed - such as
                comparing two operands and identifying where bits don't match.

                The design of the ALU is obviously a critical part of the processor and new approaches to speeding
                up instruction handling are continually being developed.</h5>

                <h3>CONTROL UNIT</h3>

                <h5>The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the
                    operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic and logic unit and input and
                    output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.
                    A control unit works by receiving input information that it converts into control signals, which are
                    then sent to the central processor. The computer's processor then tells the attached hardware what
                    operations to carry out. The functions that a control unit performs are dependent on the type of
                    CPU, due to the variance of architecture between different manufacturers. The following diagram
                    illustrates how instructions from a program are processed.

                <h3>MEMORY</h3>

                <h5>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions. Computer memory is
                    the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for
                    processing are stored. The memory is divided into large number of small parts called cells. Each
                    location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one. For example,
                    if the computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory locations. The
                    address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.

                    Memory is primarily of three types âˆ’
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cache Memory</li>
                        <li>Primary Memory/Main Memory</li>
                        <li>Secondary Memory</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cache Memory</h4>

                    Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU. It acts as a
                    buffer between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which
                    are most frequently used by the CPU. The parts of data and programs are transferred from the disk to
                    cache memory by the operating system, from where the CPU can access them.
                    <h4>Primary Memory (Main Memory)</h4>
                    Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. It
                    has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of
                    semiconductor device. These memories are not as fast as registers. The data and instruction required
                    to be processed resides in the main memory. It is divided into two subcategories RAM and ROM.
                    <h4>Secondary Memory</h4>
                    This type of memory is also known as external memory or non-volatile. It is slower than the main
                    memory. These are used for storing data/information permanently. CPU directly does not access these
                    memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines. The contents of secondary memories
                    are first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it. For example, disk, CD-ROM,
                    DVD, etc.
