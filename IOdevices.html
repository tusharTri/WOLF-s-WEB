            <h5 class=" my-2">An input is data that a computer receives. An output is data that a
                computer
                sends.An input device sends information to a computer system for processing, and an output device
                reproduces or
                displays the results of that processing. Input devices only allow for input of data to a computer and
                output
                devices only receive the output of data from another device.

                Most devices are only input devices or output devices, as they can only accept data input from a user or
                output
                data generated by a computer. However, some devices can accept input and display output, and they are
                referred
                to as I/O devices (input/output devices).

                For example, a keyboard sends electrical signals, which are received as
                input. Those signals are then interpreted by the computer and displayed, or output, on the monitor as
                text or
                images. The computer sends, or outputs, data to a printer. Then, that data is
                printed onto a piece of paper, which is also considered output.</h5>
