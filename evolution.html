    <p><b>EXISTENCE OF COMPUTER</p>
    <p>The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer. It was designed to
        calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of
        Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to c. 100 BCE. Technological artifacts of similar
        complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe
        The history of computer science began long before the modern discipline of computer science that emerged in the
        20th century, and was hinted at in the centuries prior. The progression, from mechanical inventions and
        mathematical theories towards modern computer concepts and machines, led to a major academic field and the basis
        of a massive worldwide industry
        <br>
        The earliest known tool for use in computation was the abacus, developed in the period between 2700�2300 BCE in
        Sumer. The Sumerians' abacus consisted of a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of
        magnitude of their sexagesimal number system.Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles
        . Abaci of a more modern design are still used as calculation tools today.

<p>When John Napier discovered logarithms for computational purposes in the early 17th century, there followed a period of considerable progress by inventors and scientists in making calculating tools. In 1623 Wilhelm Schickard designed a calculating machine, but abandoned the project, when the prototype he had started building was destroyed by a fire in 1624 . Around 1640, Blaise Pascal, a leading French mathematician, constructed a mechanical adding device based on a design described by Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria. Then in 1672 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz invented the Stepped Reckoner which he completed in 1694.

    In 1837 Charles Babbage first described his Analytical Engine which is accepted as the first design for a modern
    computer. The analytical engine had expandable memory, an arithmetic unit, and logic processing capabilities able to
    interpret a programming language with loops and conditional branching. Although never built, the design has been
    studied extensively and is understood to be Turing equivalent. The analytical engine would have had a memory
    capacity of less than 1 kilobyte of memory and a clock speed of less than 10 Hertz <br>

    <br>
    Considerable advancement in mathematics and electronics theory was required before the first modern computers could
    be designed.

    <p><b>BINARY LOGIC</p>
    <br><br>
    In 1702, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed logic in a formal, mathematical sense with his writings on the binary
    numeral system. In his system, the ones and zeros also represent true and false values or on and off states. But it
    took more than a century before George Boole published his Boolean algebra in 1854 with a complete system that
    allowed computational processes to be mathematically modeled
    .<br><br>
    By this time, the first mechanical devices driven by a binary pattern had been invented. The industrial revolution
    had driven forward the mechanization of many tasks, and this included weaving. Punched cards controlled Joseph Marie
    Jacquard's loom in 1801, where a hole punched in the card indicated a binary one and an unpunched spot indicated a
    binary zero. Jacquard's loom was far from being a computer, but it did illustrate that machines could be driven by
    binary systems<br>

    <p><b>BIRTH OF COMPUTER</p>
    <p>Before the 1920s, computers (sometimes computors) were human clerks that performed computations. They were
        usually under the lead of a physicist. Many thousands of computers were employed in commerce, government, and
        research establishments. Most of these computers were women. Some performed astronomical calculations for
        calendars, others ballistic tables for the military.
        <br><br>
        After the 1920s, the expression computing machine referred to any machine that performed the work of a human
        computer, especially those in accordance with effective methods of the Church-Turing thesis. The thesis states
        that a mathematical method is effective if it could be set out as a list of instructions able to be followed by
        a human clerk with paper and pencil, for as long as necessary, and without ingenuity or insight
        <br><br><img src="calculator.jpg" style="width:440;height:350;">
        Machines that computed with continuous values became known as the analog kind. They used machinery that
        represented continuous numeric quantities, like the angle of a shaft rotation or difference in electrical
        potential.
        <br><br>
        Digital machinery, in contrast to analog, were able to render a state of a numeric value and store each
        individual digit. Digital machinery used difference engines or relays before the invention of faster memory
        devices.
        <br><br>
        The phrase computing machine gradually gave way, after the late 1940s, to just computer as the onset of
        electronic digital machinery became common. These computers were able to perform the calculations that were
        performed by the previous human clerks.
        Since the values stored by digital machines were not bound to physical properties like analog devices, a logical
        computer, based on digital equipment, was able to do anything that could be described "purely mechanical." The
        theoretical Turing Machine, created by Alan Turing, is a hypothetical device theorized in order to study the
        properties of such hardware.
        <br><br>
        Charles Babbage is often regarded as one of the first pioneers of computing. Beginning in the 1810s, Babbage had
        a vision of mechanically computing numbers and tables. Putting this into reality, Babbage designed a calculator
        to compute numbers up to 8 decimal points long. Continuing with the success of this idea, Babbage worked to
        develop a machine that could compute numbers with up to 20 decimal places. By the 1830s, Babbage had devised a
        plan to develop a machine that could use punched cards to perform arithmetical operations. The machine would
        store numbers in memory units, and there would be a form of sequential control. This means that one operation
        would be carried out before another in such a way that the machine would produce an answer and not fail. This
        machine was to be known as the �Analytical Engine�, which was the first true representation of what is the
        modern computer.
        <br><br>
        Ada Lovelace (Augusta Ada Byron) is credited as the pioneer of computer programming and is regarded as a
        mathematical genius, a result of the mathematically heavy tutoring regimen her mother assigned to her as a young
        girl. Lovelace began working with Charles Babbage as an assistant while Babbage was working on his �Analytical
        Engine�, the first mechanical computer. During her work with Babbage, Ada Lovelace became the designer of the
        first computer algorithm, which had the ability to compute Bernoulli numbers. Moreover, Lovelace�s work with
        Babbage resulted in her prediction of future computers to not only perform mathematical calculations, but also
        manipulate symbols, mathematical or not. While she was never able to see the results of her work, as the
        �Analytical Engine� was not created in her lifetime, her efforts in later years, beginning in the 1940s, did not
        go unnoticed.
        <br><br>
        In 1946, he designed the first high-level programming language, Plankalk�l.

    <p><b>ENIAC, 1946
            Regarded as the first general purpose electronic computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer
            (ENIAC) was initially commissioned for the use in World War II, but not completed until one year after the
            war had ended . Installed at the University of Pennsylvania, its 40 separate eight-foot-high racks and
            18,000 tubes were intended to help calculate ballistic trajectories.</P>

        Part of a family of interchangeable computers, the IBM System/360 mainframe was the first to cover a complete
        range of applications, from small to large, from commercial to scientific. Users were able to enlarge or shrink
        their setup without having to make headache-inducing software upgrades as well. Higher-end System/360 models had
        roles in NASA's Apollo missions as well as air traffic control systems.
