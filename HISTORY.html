                    Sumer. The Sumerians' abacus consisted of a table of successive columns which delimited the

                    orders of

                designed to
                calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek
                island of
                Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to c. <b>100 BCE</b>. Technological artifacts

                complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in

                in the
                20th century, and was hinted at in the centuries prior. The progression, from mechanical inventions and
                mathematical theories towards modern computer concepts and machines, led to a major academic field and

                1623 Wilhelm Schickard designed a calculating machine, but abandoned the project, when the prototype he
                had started building was destroyed by a fire in 1624 . Around 1640, Blaise Pascal, a leading French
                mathematician, constructed a mechanical adding device based on a design described by Greek mathematician
                Hero of Alexandria. Then in 1672 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz invented the Stepped Reckoner which he
                completed in 1694.</h5>

            <h3 class="mx-auto d-block">BINARY LOGIC</h3>
            <h5 class="py-1 py-3">In 1702, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed logic in a formal, mathematical sense
                with his writings on the binary
                numeral system. In his system, the ones and zeros also represent true and false values or on and off
                states. But it
                took more than a century before George Boole published his Boolean algebra in 1854 with a complete
                system that
                allowed computational processes to be mathematically modeled
                .<br>
                By this time, the first mechanical devices driven by a binary pattern had been invented. The industrial
                revolution
                had driven forward the mechanization of many tasks, and this included weaving. Punched cards controlled
                Joseph Marie
                Jacquard's loom in 1801, where a hole punched in the card indicated a binary one and an unpunched spot
                indicated a
                binary zero. Jacquard's loom was far from being a computer, but it did illustrate that machines could be
                driven by
                binary systems</h5>

                HOW IT WAS NAMED : COMPUTER</h2>
            <h5>Before the 1920s, computers (sometimes computors)
                were <b>human clerks</b> that performed computations. They were
                usually under the lead of a physicist. Many thousands of computers were employed in commerce,
                government,
                and
                research establishments. Most of these computers were women. Some performed astronomical calculations
                for
                calendars, others ballistic tables for the military.
                <br><br>
                After the 1920s, the expression <b>computing machine</b> referred to any machine that performed the work
                of a human
                computer.
                Machines that computed with continuous values became known as the analog kind. They used machinery that
                represented continuous numeric quantities, like the angle of a shaft rotation or difference in
                electrical
                potential.
                <br><br>
                The phrase computing machine gradually gave way, after the late 1940s, to just computer as the onset of
                electronic digital machinery became common. These computers were able to perform the calculations that
                were
                performed by the previous human clerks.
                Since the values stored by digital machines were not bound to physical properties like analog devices, a
                logical
                computer, based on digital equipment, was able to do anything that could be described "purely
                mechanical."
                The
                theoretical Turing Machine, created by Alan Turing, is a hypothetical device theorized in order to study
                the
                properties of such hardware.
